# Devops-Roadmap

# Introduction
> Hello and welcome to this comprehensive DevOps roadmap guide. In this session, we'll break down the essential skills, tools, and practices you'll need to master in your journey to becoming a proficient DevOps engineer. Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to refine your existing knowledge, this roadmap will provide you with a structured path to success

** Section 1: Understanding DevOps

# What is DevOps?

> DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its goal is to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
Key principles include collaboration, automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and monitoring.


# Why DevOps?

* Faster time to market.
* Improved collaboration and communication.
* Enhanced product quality.
* Greater customer satisfaction.
